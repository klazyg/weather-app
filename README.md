This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).


# :sunny: Weather App
Weather App is a web application that uses a weather API to display weather data for any entered location. Users can see the current temperature, real feel, humidity, wind speed, as well as the highest and lowest temperatures. The app provides a simple and convenient way for users to check the weather conditions in any location.


## :gear: Running

After cloning the project repository, run the following command in the terminal to install all dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

To run the development server, execute the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Once the server is running, the project will be available at http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

You can also start editing the page by modifying the pages/index.tsx file. The page will automatically update as you edit the file.

Alternatively, you can use the GitHub CLI interface to clone the repository with the following command:

```bash
gh repo clone klazyg/weather-app
```

## ðŸ‘‰ First steps
To use the Weather App, simply type in the name of the city you are interested in into the empty text field and press "Enter" or click on the magnifying glass icon located on the right-hand side.

After selecting a city, the application will automatically display the current weather information for that location. You can input different cities at any time without the need to refresh the page.
