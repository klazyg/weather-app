# :sunny: Weather App
Weather App is a web application that uses a weather API to display weather data for any entered location. Users can see the current temperature, real feel, humidity, wind speed, as well as the highest and lowest temperatures. The app provides a simple and convenient way for users to check the weather conditions in any location.


## :gear: Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

Alternatively, you can use GitHub CLI, which allows you to clone, fork, and manage the repository directly from the command line. To clone the repository using GitHub CLI, type the following command in your terminal:

```bash
gh repo clone klazyg/weather-app
```

## ðŸ‘‰ First steps
To use the Weather App, simply type in the name of the city you are interested in into the empty text field and press "Enter" or click on the magnifying glass icon located on the right-hand side.

After selecting a city, the application will automatically display the current weather information for that location. You can input different cities at any time without the need to refresh the page.
